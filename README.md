## Ponderings
I'm thinking of this repo becoming a collection of scripts, for easy implementation of various technologies. Like websockets and SQLite.
A main requirement would be no dependencies other than the most necessary.
The purpose is to learn how to use these technologies, illustrate best practices and basic implementations, and to simply copy/paste into projects.

I understant that AI can easily create these scripts, but I believe its better to learn and understand the code than simply relying on convenient tools. That said this is very convenient and easy to use without learning the code.

# Content
## SQLite
Scripts for creating and interacting with a sqlite3 database.

## Contribute
If you want to contribute scripts for different languages, or feel existing scripts need improving, feel free to create PR's!

Please ensure the contributions align with the repo's purpose of simple, dependency light scripts for learning.
